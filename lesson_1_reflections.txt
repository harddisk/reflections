How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Diff shows the differences between 2 files without discrimination. Typos
	happens and easily missed with the naked eyes. With a software operated
	file comparator, it's easier and a lot faster to track minute changes in
	files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	With revision history, one can always backtrack to earlier copies of file /
	coding if new changes applied were not up to expectation. Undoing codes
	manually can be tedious and mistakes often happen.
